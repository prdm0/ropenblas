Description: The 'ropenblas' package (<https://prdm0.github.io/ropenblas/>) is useful for users of any 'GNU/Linux' distribution. It will be possible to download, compile and link the 'OpenBLAS' library (<https://www.openblas.net/>) with the R language, always by the same procedure, regardless of the 'GNU/Linux' distribution used. With the 'ropenblas' package it is possible to download, compile and link the latest version of the 'OpenBLAS' library even the repositories of the 'GNU/Linux' distribution used do not include the latest versions of 'OpenBLAS'. If of interest, older versions of the 'OpenBLAS' library may be considered. Linking R with an optimized version of 'BLAS' (<https://netlib.org/blas/>) may improve the computational performance of R code. The 'OpenBLAS' library is an optimized implementation of 'BLAS' that can be easily linked to R with the 'ropenblas' package.
