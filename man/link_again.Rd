\title{Relink the OpenBLAS library with R}
\usage{
link_again(restart_r = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{restart_r}{If \code{TRUE} (default), a new R session is started after linking the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library.}
}
\description{
The \code{link_again} function relinks the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library with the R language, which is useful for correcting
unlinking problems that are common when the operating system is updated.
}
\details{
The \code{link_again} function can relink the R language with the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library. Thus, link_again will only perform the
relinking when the ropenblas function has been used in a previous R session for the initial binding of the R language with the
\href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library.

Relinking is useful in situations of operating system updates. In some updates, it is possible that the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library compiled
in the \code{/opt} directory gets unlinked. In this scenario, when the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library has already been compiled using the ropenblas
function, the \code{link_again} function performs a new link without the need to recompile, thus making the process less time
consuming.
}
\note{
In situations where there was a disconnection due to an operating system update, the \code{ropenblas} function can be used to
re-link the OpenBLAS library with the R language, however, it will be necessary to compile the
\href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library again. If you are interested in recompiling the
\href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library and linking with R, use the \code{\link{ropenblas}} function. If the
interest is to take advantage of a previous compilation of the \href{https://www.openblas.net/}{\strong{OpenBLAS}} library, the
\code{link_again} function may be useful.
