\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.pdf}{NEWS.pdf} will be opened.}

\description{
Returns the contents of the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html}{NEWS.html} file in the standard browser installed on the operating system.
}
\details{
The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html}{NEWS.html} file contains the main changes from the recently released versions of the R language.
The goal is to facilitate the query by invoking it directly from the R command prompt. The \link{rnews} function is
analogous to the \link{news} function of the \strong{utils} package. However, using the \link{news} command in a terminal style
bash shell, it is possible to receive a message like:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{news()
starting httpd help server ... done
Error in browseURL(url) : 'browser' must be a non-empty character string
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This is an error that may occur depending on the installation of R. Always prefer the use of the news
function, but if you need to, use the \link{rnews} function.
